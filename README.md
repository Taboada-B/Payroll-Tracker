# Payroll-Tracker
## Functionality
The payroll tracker will dynamically receive information from a user, including an employee's first name, last name, and salary, and input this information into a grid.  The application will organize the employees alphabetically by their last name, average the salary, and randomly select an employee to be a winner!
